Setup - Tquant (univs,exists) innerPackages

Terminology - The Tquant level is being called the outer level and innerPackages level
              is called the inner level in the algorithm below.

1) First reduce every package. 

2) Substitution list is obtained for the existential variables of the outer level equation
   by looking at the free variables of the inner packages.We will also have a few exitentials
   that may not have a corresponding substitution.

3) Then using the substitution obtained from the existential variables from the outer 
   level q each package.

4) In order to see if linearization by a substitution@(x,Term) (for an existential of the outer 
   level equation) can occur look at the free variables of each inner package.
          True  -> Package can be linearized.Linearize with respect to the substitution.
          False -> Move on to the next package

5) As  a result of linearization of packages, there might be substitution available for some existential
   variables of the local package now. Deal with those exitentials.

6) Do this for all the packages such that all packages are in their most reduced form.

7) At the outer leavel combine the packages taking into account the fact that there might be some left
   over existentials from the outer level.

8) This is the package that will be returned for the outer level TQuant equation.

-- Alternatively one can delay the stage through 5 to 8. Combine all the packages post linearization 
   even if a substitution occurs in the package for the local existential. Get rid of the combined
   existentials in one go now.

-- Although this is avoids the localization principle to an extent, this might be more efficient as
   it is not often that existential will get a substituion post linearization, so one would not
   end up wasting a lot of time checking for this for every linearization of  a substitution for
   every package.
